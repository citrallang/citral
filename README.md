# citral, WIP

All the following are plans that may change, and likely are not implemented.

Citral is a general-purpose, high level, typed (with inference) language written in C. It features a garbage collector, interoperability with several major languages (hopefully), and a twin compiler/interpreter. This does not mean JIT.
